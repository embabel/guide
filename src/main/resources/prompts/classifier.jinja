Classify the latest user message in this conversation exchange.

Conversation (most recent messages):
{{ conversationContext }}

The latest user message is: "{{ userMessage }}"

conversational = true:
The message is ONLY a reaction, greeting, thanks, or small talk with no action needed.
Examples: "thanks!", "nice", "hello", "haha", "goodbye"

conversational = false:
The message needs information lookup, code generation, or the assistant to DO something.
This includes:
- Direct questions or requests ("how does X work?", "show me an example")
- User AGREEING to something the assistant offered or proposed
  ("yeah that would be cool", "sure go ahead", "yes please", "do it")
- Continuing or deepening a topic ("what about error handling?", "tell me more")

IMPORTANT: If the assistant just offered, proposed, or suggested doing something,
and the user is affirming or accepting — classify as conversational = false.

If conversational = true, generate a brief, warm 1-2 sentence response in character.
