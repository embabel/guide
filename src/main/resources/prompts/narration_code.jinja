Rewrite the following markdown as plain text suitable for text-to-speech.
Remove all markdown formatting.
For code blocks, links and other items that would be verbose to narrate: Say "I have attached a (item name) on screen". Then, if it helps, describe what that item is about in natural language instead of reading it verbatim.
For code blocks, keep variable and function names when they aid understanding, but do not recite raw syntax.
