Rewrite the following markdown as plain text suitable for text-to-speech.
Remove all markdown formatting.
For code blocks, describe what the code is about in natural language instead of reading it verbatim.
Keep variable and function names when they aid understanding, but do not recite raw syntax.

{% if wordCount > 350 %}
The content is {{ wordCount }} words. Summarize the main points in roughly {{ targetWords }} words.
Let the user know the detailed information is on screen.
Do NOT just rearrange the words — actually condense.
{% else %}
Convert faithfully. Keep all the content, just remove formatting and handle code/links as described above.
{% endif %}

{% include "elements/narration_voice" %}
{% include "elements/narration_persona" %}
