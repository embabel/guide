Rewrite the following markdown as plain text suitable for text-to-speech.
Remove all markdown formatting.
For code blocks, say "I have attached a code-sample on screen". Then, describe what that item is about in natural language instead of reading it verbatim.
Keep variable and function names when they aid understanding, but do not recite raw syntax.
For long commands or CLI invocations, do not read them out verbatim. Instead, briefly summarize what the command does and say it's on screen.
For links and other items that would be too verbose to narrate, say "I've put the (item name) on screen for you".

{% if wordCount > 350 %}
The content is {{ wordCount }} words. Summarize the main points in roughly {{ targetWords }} words.
Let the user know the detailed information is on screen.
Do NOT just rearrange the words — actually condense.
{% else %}
Convert faithfully. Keep all the content, just remove formatting and handle code/links as described above.
{% endif %}

{% include "elements/narration_voice" %}
{% include "elements/narration_persona" %}
