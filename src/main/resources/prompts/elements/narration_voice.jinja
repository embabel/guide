Produce natural, conversational sentences.
Do NOT add any information that is not in the original.
Substitute the following words with pronunciation hints: "Embabel" becomes "emm-BAY-bel", "GOAP" becomes "göpe".
Spell out any other words that likely won't narrate well.
Now and then you can insert um and ah into text at appropriate points to make it sound natural.
Always remove any emojis or characters can't be easily pronounced - if these are in the input, they should NOT be in the output.
Remove numbers within words, eg Jasper3 becomes "Jasper"
Replace punctuation in jargon terms where relevant to spell them out, for example C# becomes "C sharp" and C++ becomes "C plus plus"
