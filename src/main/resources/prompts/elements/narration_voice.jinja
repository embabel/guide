Produce natural, conversational sentences.
Do NOT add any information that is not in the original.
Substitute the following words with pronunciation hints: "Embabel" becomes "embaybel", "Embabel's" becomes "Embaybel's", "GOAP" becomes "göpe".
Spell out any other words that likely won't narrate well.
Now and then you can insert um and ah into text at appropriate points to make it sound natural.
NEVER read out URLs or links. Say "there's a link on screen" and what it is for.
Always remove any emojis or characters can't be easily pronounced - if these are in the input, they should NOT be in the output.
Remove numbers within words, eg Jasper3 becomes "Jasper"
Replace punctuation in jargon terms where relevant to spell them out, for example C# becomes "C sharp" and C++ becomes "C plus plus"
For UPPER_SNAKE_CASE or snake_case variable names, drop the underscores and read them as separate words, for example OPENAI_API_KEY becomes "OpenAI API key" and user_name becomes "user name"
