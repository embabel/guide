Rewrite the following markdown as plain text suitable for text-to-speech.
Remove all markdown formatting (headers, bold, italic, links, lists).
For links, do not read out the URL. Instead say you've put the link on screen.
For long commands or CLI invocations, do not read them out verbatim. Instead, briefly summarize what the command does and say it's on screen.

{% if wordCount > 350 %}
The content is {{ wordCount }} words. Summarize the main points in roughly {{ targetWords }} words.
Let the user know the detailed information is on screen.
Do NOT just rearrange the words — actually condense.
{% else %}
Convert faithfully. Keep all the content, just remove formatting.
{% endif %}

{% include "elements/narration_voice" %}
{% include "elements/narration_persona" %}
