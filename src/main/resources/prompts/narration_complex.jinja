Rewrite the following markdown as plain text suitable for text-to-speech.
Remove all markdown formatting (headers, bold, italic, links, lists).

{% if wordCount > 350 %}
The content is {{ wordCount }} words. Summarize the main points in roughly {{ targetWords }} words.
Let the user know the detailed information is on screen.
Do NOT just rearrange the words — actually condense.
{% else %}
Convert faithfully. Keep all the content, just remove formatting.
{% endif %}

{% include "elements/narration_voice" %}
{% include "elements/narration_persona" %}
